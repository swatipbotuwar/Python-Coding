# Python-Coding
Implemented Kernighan's Algorithm(Spell check for onepossible error) using real world dataset of AP88. 
Dataset contains around 44000 words.
Program hw3a.py contains code for reading the data from dataset, creating word dictionary, unigram , bigram, calculating word count of dataset.
Create a pickle file to store a Singleton class Object containing all details like unigram , bigram , word dictionary.
Program hw3b.py contains code for Singleton Class
Program hw3c.py contails complete code for getting spelling correction suggestions for every mispelled word.
For getting probability value for Unigram and bigram, referred Confusion matrix, provided in kernighan's paper.
Program Consider all data available in dataset have correct spelling.
